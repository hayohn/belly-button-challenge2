# Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](https://github.com/<username>/<repository>/blob/main/images/bacteria.jpg)

## Project Overview

The Belly Button Biodiversity project explores the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This interactive dashboard allows users to explore the bacterial species that colonize the human belly button. Users can select a test subject ID number from the dropdown menu to view the top 10 bacterial species found in that individual, as well as a bubble chart displaying the relative abundance of all bacterial species.

## Features

- Dropdown menu to select a test subject ID number
- Bar chart displaying the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) for the selected individual
- Bubble chart showing the relative abundance of all bacterial species for the selected individual
- Metadata panel presenting demographic information of the selected individual
